Overview
--------

On this page you will find a collection of resources that will help you settle in the Logsdail research group. This resource is not exhaustive and suggested additions are always welcomed!

Meetings
--------

* | **1-to-1 meetings with Andy are run every Tuesday.**
  | Timetable is organised dynamically through the #meetings channel on Slack (See :ref:`Tools`)

* | `Journal Club <https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/jenkinshj1_cardiff_ac_uk/EZhNkd7dxqxMrxxmo63ixGsBFIWYWzEOwT1gMNp9VYgBcQ?e=6R4K8r>`_ is 1-2pm on the 1st and 3rd Friday of every month. 
  | (*Request permission from Harry if you cannot access!*)

* | `School-wide Computational Chemistry Seminars <https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/roldanmartineza_cardiff_ac_uk/EWbjXu4OLZ5Oi1KHnZrMwQQB2Vaed6CwAYsppOTLsA34bQ?e=ivfP8A>`_ run on the final Friday of every month. 
  | (*Please note the dates when you are speaking!*)

Tools
-----
* `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/logsdail/shared_invite/enQtNzYzNDg1MzA3NDQ3LTZjZjQ0OWZjN2Y4OGUzOTZlZGRlNDU1OWNlOGM2MmMzYjM2NDRmYzczYjM1ODBkYTQ2ZDk4NTUzOTljMzkzMTk>`_ : Communication platform for the group.

* `Trello <https://trello.com>`_ : Project planning platform - prompt Andy to setup a board for your project.

* Also prompt Andy (via email to LogsdailA@cardiff.ac.uk) to organise keycard access for your office!

Tutorials
---------
* `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ : Our main working environment. There are loads of tutorials out there, examples are (running from least to most interactive):

  * `Python 3 Official Documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_
  * `Learn Python <https://www.learnpython.org/>`_
  * `w3schools <https://www.w3schools.com/python/>`_
  * `Code Academy <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python>`_

* `Atomic Simulation Environment <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/tutorials/tutorials.html>`_ : Our main working environment for running simulations. 

* `FHI-aims <https://aimsclub.gitlab.io/tutorial/>`_ : Quantum mechanical software for calculating electronic structure of molecules and materials.

* `Bash <https://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp>`_ : A necessity on the supercomputing environments, so start early!

Computing Facilities
--------------------
* | `Hawk <https://portal.supercomputing.wales/index.php/index/>`_ : The Welsh supercomputing facility. 
  | Register to access through `this web portal <https://portal.supercomputing.wales/index.php/getting-access/>`_ and join project `SCW1057`. 
  
.. note::
  * When you login, you are in your home directory: `/home/<username>/`

  * Work is done in the scratch directory only: `/scratch/<username>/`

  * Examples of how to run software is in the project shared directory: `/home/scw1057/`

* `Isambard <https://gw4-isambard.github.io/docs/>`_ : The Tier-2 facility accessed through the GW4 consortium.

* `ARCHER <https://www.archer.ac.uk/>`_ : Our access is managed through the `Materials Chemistry Consortium <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/mcc/>`_, with proposal deadlines every 6 months.

.. note::
   Remember that you'll need to install ASE, or any other Python modules, into your personal workspace on these supercomputers. This is performed using `pip3 install --user <modulename>`

Administration
--------------
| Throughout the PhD, you'll have to do paperwork to ensure continuous progression. 
| All documents for this are on `Learning Central <https://learningcentral.cf.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3387725_1&course_id=_368439_1>`_ under "CHEMY - Research Student Information".
