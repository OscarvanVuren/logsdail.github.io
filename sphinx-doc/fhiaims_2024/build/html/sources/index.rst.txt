within institutions in the UK as well as exhibiting new features and recent developments.

Time and Place
--------------

The meeting is being hosted by the `Maurer Group <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/maurer/maurergroup/>`_ at `The University of Warwick <https://warwick.ac.uk/>`_ from the 15th to the 16th of May 2024.
The venue is the Science Concourse within the Physics Department. Directions can be found on this `interactive campus map <https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/>`_.

Accommodation and Travel

This meeting will include a number of tutorials before the main sessions of talks. The topics of these tutorials are ultimately to be driven by what attendees wish to
see tutorials on however there will be a session on the fundamentals of FHI-aims and hwo best to utilise the software. Other, more advanced tutorials will be available and
will be published here in due course.

After the closing of the main body of the meeting, all attendees are invited to a code hack, wherein the developers of the codebase will get together and take part in some
collaborative coding. The organisers would like to invite anyone with a suggestion for features to be included in FHI-aims to write these into the appropriate box during
