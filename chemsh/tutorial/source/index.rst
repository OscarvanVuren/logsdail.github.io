| The following documentation assumes you are comfortable understanding python code to an intermediate level. All calculations are carried out using scripts written in python. These filetypes are denoted by .py and must be run using the chemsh alias. As such, the input command for running the python files should look like this: :mod:`chemsh file-name.py`. If you would like to read up more on python, try `w3schools <https://www.w3schools.com/python/>`_.
