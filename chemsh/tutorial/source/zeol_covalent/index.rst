*A case study by Sam Watts and Rowan Hanson, Cardiff University. We gratefully acknowledge support from CCP5 for this work.*


Welcome! These tutorials are designed to help you learn more about QM/MM methods in their application for zeolite modelling.

Throughout the calculations included in the tutorials, where described forcefields have been taken from the following paper: 

`Molecular Mechanics Potential for Silica and Zeolite Catalysts Based on ab Initio Calculations. 2. Aluminosilicates <https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/j100023a036>`_
